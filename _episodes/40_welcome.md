As you know by know the number of viral sequences is exploding, and the existing taxonomy often has to be adjusted to accommodate these newly discovered viral sequences. At the same time this increase in available data allows researchers to improve the methods and signals that are used to demarcate meaningful biological taxonomic groups. As a result viral taxonomy is a very much an **active field of research**.

Today we will first read and discuss a recent perspective on viral taxonomic classification. In the rest of the day we will use different approaches to taxonomically annotate the viral contigs we assembled in the previous days, and compare the results from different methods.
