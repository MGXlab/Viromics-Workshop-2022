Viral taxonomy is a very **active field of research**. As you know by know the number of viral sequences is expanding exponentially, and the existing taxonomy often has to be adjusted to accomodate these newly discovered viral sequences. At the same time the increase in available data allows researchers to improve the methods and signals that are used to demarcate meaningful biological taxonomic groups.

Today we will first read and discuss a recent perspective paper on taxonomic classification. In the rest of the day we will use different approaches to taxonomically annotate the viral contigs we assembled in the previous days, and compare the results from different methods.
