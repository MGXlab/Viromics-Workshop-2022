Viral taxonomy is a very **active field of research**. As you know by now, the number of viral sequences is increasing rapidly through the discovery of uncultivated viruses with metagenomics. Some of these new viruses can be directly placed in the viral taxonomy. However, often the taxonomy has to be adjusted to accommodate these newly discovered viral sequences.
The taxonomy is regularly updated by reports of the [International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)](https://talk.ictvonline.org/), the organisation that governs the nomenclature and classification of viral taxonomy.

The increase in viral sequences also allows researchers to improve the methods and signals that are used to demarcate meaningful biological taxonomic groups. Currently there is no single best method (or consensus) to classify viruses: methods differ depending on the taxonomic rank you're interested in (say family or species), or can be specific to a given taxon (for example, a set of hallmark genes that characterises the [*Schitoviridae*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33008130/)).

Today we will use different approaches to try to taxonomically annotate the viral sequences you have recovered in the previous days.
