For today we will need the following datasets from the previous days:

- binned sequences (day 1)
- predicted protein sequences for these bins (day 3)
- protein annotations (day 3)

Please check if you can locate these files. If didn't get that far on the previous
days and as a backup we also provide the files for you to download:
